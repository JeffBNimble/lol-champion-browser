/* Why or how did I pick these dimensions 120px by 218px? First, I think I want to use the champion
   loading images here. I know from researching that the champion loading images are 308px by 560px.
   Using simple math, I calculated (roughly) what the height of the image should be if I wanted a width
   of 120px. 308 divided by 560 is .55. So to get 218 (roughly), you divide 120 by .55. I chose 120px as
   the width because it's big enough to show the image. I may tweak these dimensions in the future depending
   upon how things look. But using this simple math formula allows me to retain the aspect ratio of the image
   without causing it to skew.
